<p>The core API for working with Fudge encoded data.</p>

<p>In general, most applications will start with an instance of {@link org.fudgemsg.FudgeContext},
and use that to read, write, and persist instances of {@link org.fudgemsg.FudgeFieldContainer}
using the reader and writer classes.</p>

<p>Applications requiring serialization of more complex Java objects and automated support for
encoding objects to/from Fudge messages should use the {@link org.fudgemsg.mapping} package.</p>
